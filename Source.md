A source is the combination of a [character](./Character.md) and effect, usually tracked to prevent stacking.  
  
A source is the same if both the character using an ability and the ability being used are the same.  
  
A source is not the same if two separate characters use the same ability, or if the same character uses differently named abilities.  
  
A source has all of the properties of both its origin and ability.
