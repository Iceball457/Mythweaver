When a character receives damage, they mark [[./Damage Type|Type]] and amount of damage that was received. Certain types of damage are harder to heal, although magical healing and harming can remove any kind of damage.

When an NPC or monster receives damage, you need only mark the amount, unless healing will come into play for that character. In general, mundane types are not significant enough to mark separately.
