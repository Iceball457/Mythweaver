A [character](./Character.md) can't be hidden unless they have [Cover](./Cover.md) to all [Seekers](./Seeker.md). A [character](./Character.md) that is hidden can't be the target of effects that require sight or an exact position; but can still be the target of effects that target by name, and can be included in areas of effect.
