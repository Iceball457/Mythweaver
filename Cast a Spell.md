# Channeling  
  
As an [Action](./Action.md), you begin charging a spell. Pay the costs of the spell. If the spell's [Casting Time](./Casting%20Time.md) is instant, resolve the spell immediately. Otherwise, your turn ends. At the beginning of your first turn after the spell's casting time ends, resolve the spell.  
  
Charging a spell can be [Interrupted](./Interrupt.md). If you take any damage while casting, you must make a [Vitality](./Vitality.md) [Saving Throw](./Saving%20Throw.md) against a DC equal to 13 plus the sum of damage taken, or have the spell disrupted by damage.  
  
If you take other actions or reaction before the casting time is up, the spell is disrupted.  
  
# Resolution  
Once the spell is ready to resolve, make a [Skill Check](./Skill%20Check.md) against the attribute you use for your [Magical Tradition](./Magical%20Tradition.md). On a pass, perform the effects of the spell as listed. On a failure, the spell is usually lost.
