When you are within an area of effect, as an [Action](./Action.md), make an [Agility](./Agility.md) [Saving Throw](./Saving%20Throw.md). If you succeed, you may immediately [Step](./Step.md). If this step brings you out of range, that attack or ability doesn't apply to you.  
  
### Amped Effect  
You can use this reaction against attacks, instead of bracing or avoiding. If you are still in range, you take damage as if you braced and failed (normally 2x damage).
