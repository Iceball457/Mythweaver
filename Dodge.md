When you are within an area of effect, as an [Action](./Action.md), make an [Agility](./Agility.md) [Saving Throw](./Saving%20Throw.md). If you succeed, you may immediately [Step](./Step.md). If this step brings you out of range, that ability doesn't apply to you.  
  
### Amped Effect  
You can use this reaction to avoid attacks, instead of bracing. Instead of rolling an [Armor Saving Throw](./Armor%20Saving%20Throw.md) against the weapon's brace attribute, you may roll a saving throw against the weapon's [Avoid Attribute](./Avoid%20Attribute.md).
