Spells can be prepared at any time a character is resting. Every [Stretch](./Stretch.md) spent resting, the preparer gains an amount of research, favor, mana, or tempo equal to the appropriate casting attribute.  
  
After deciding how many stretches to spend preparing spells, the preparer may then convert all of the collected resources into spells on their character sheet, and may additionally spend parchment to convert those spells into spell scrolls.  
  
[Arcane](./Arcane.md) and [Divine](./Divine.md) spells always have to be prepared. [Primal](./Primal.md) and [Occult](./Occult.md) spells only have to be prepared when creating scrolls.

When you choose multiple spells, choose an order to research them in. If your rest is interrupted, your DM should tell you how many stretches passed before you were interrupted. You still successfully prepared any spells completed before the interruption.
