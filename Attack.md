## Attack  
  
As an [Action](./Action.md), choose a target within the range of your weapon, then make an [Attack Roll](./Attack%20Roll.md) using the [Weapon](./Weapon.md)'s [Attack Attribute](./Attack%20Attribute.md) against the weapon's weight. On a success, the opponent rolls a [Saving Throw](./Saving%20Throw.md) using their choice of the weapon's [Brace](./Brace%20Attribute.md) and [Avoid Attributes](./Avoid%20Attribute.md), also against the weapon's weight.  
  
The [Damage](./Damage.md) of your attack is equal to the weapon's damage, plus a your [Damage Scaling](./Damage%20Scaling.md). The defender takes half damage on a successful saving throw.  
  
You may only attack once each turn.  
  
### Amped Effect  
  
You may attack multiple times per turn.
