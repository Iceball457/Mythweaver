When you need to perform a skill check, roll a d20 and add the appropriate attribute. If the result is equal to or greater than the DC of the skill check you get a *Pass*, otherwise you get a *Fail*. Certain effects will ask for the number result instead of just pass or fail.  
  
A skill check of average difficulty has a DC of 21, and most DCs fall between 18 and 24  
  
`d20 + attr >= DC`
