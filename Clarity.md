# Cast  
  
Your mental fog is cleared, and the veil of reality is revealed.  
  
Until you fall asleep, you never fall for illusions and you can see invisibility. ^effect  
  
You still have to notice the illusion as they are not automatically *revealed*, you just don't have to make a skill check to disbelieve it.
