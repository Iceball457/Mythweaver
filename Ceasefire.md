As an [Action](./Action.md), choose an enemy and roll a [Charisma](./Charisma.md) [Skill Check](./Skill%20Check.md). On a success, that enemy will flee the encounter or otherwise stop fighting. You are allowed to know if this is possible before committing to the action. This will be more difficult if the enemy is winning the fight, and you may not even be required to roll if you are winning.  
  
### Amped Effect  
You affect all enemies instead of just one. This may end the encounter if all enemies are able and willing to be peaceful.
