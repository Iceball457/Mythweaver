# Cast  
  
You pull the fire or another effect out of the target, and use it to make an attack.  
  
You pull the elements out of a willing burning, chilled, poisoned, or shocked target and imbue them into a weapon you can touch. The next attack made with that weapon deals an additional `1d4` damage of the corresponding type, and applies that status on a failed save. ^effect
