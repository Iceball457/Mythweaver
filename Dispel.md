# Cast  
  
You wrap an area with anti-magic.  
  
A 20' burst in range becomes enveloped in anti-magic. Spells cannot be cast from this area, or targeting this area. If that would happen, the spell is disrupted instead. Already ongoing spells with a duration end immediately. ^effect  
  
Spells that would cause an effect without targeting are also disrupted. Areas of effect may be only partially disrupted.
