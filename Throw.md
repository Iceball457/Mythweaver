As an [Action](./Action.md), determine a target you can grab, and a direction you wish to throw them. You roll a [Strength](./Strength.md) [Skill Check](./Skill%20Check.md), and the target rolls a strength [Saving Throw](./Saving%20Throw.md). The distance of your throw is equal to the difference between the rolls in feet, if yours is greater. Round up to the nearest [Tile](./Tile.md).  
  
### Amped Effect  
You throw the target twice as far. Calculate this after finding the difference between the two rolls, but before rounding.
