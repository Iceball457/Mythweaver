As an [[./Action|Action]], determine a target you can grab, and a direction you wish to throw them. You roll a [[./Strength|Strength]] [[./Skill Check|Skill Check]], and the target rolls a strength [[./Saving Throw|Saving Throw]]. The distance of your throw is equal to the difference between the rolls in feet, if yours is greater. Round up to the nearest [[./Tile|Tile]].

### Amped Effect
You throw the target twice as far. Calculate this after finding the difference between the two rolls, but before rounding.
