# Cast  
  
You peer into the future, for one minute, you can't take any actions other than focusing on this spell. After 1 minute passes, choose to accept your fate and keep going, or snap out of the vision and return to the moment you cast this spell (in all potential futures, you spend the minute focused on this spell). ^effect
