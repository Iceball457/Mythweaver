Armor increases the DC of incoming attacks.

When armor is [[./Shred|Shredded]], the amount of cover granted is reduced by the shred value.

Characters must have enough [[./Strength|Strength]] to efficiently wear armor, or be subject to a penalty to all [[./Skill Check|Skills Checks]] and [[./Saving Throw|Saving Throws]] equal to the difference.

Armor can be affected by [[./Intrinsic Enchantment|Intrinsic Enchantment]]. Improve the weight and cover by the intrinsic enchantment value.
