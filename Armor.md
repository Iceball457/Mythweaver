Armor increases the DC of incoming attacks.  
  
When armor is [Shredded](./Shred.md), the amount of cover granted is reduced by the shred value.  
  
Characters must have enough [Strength](./Strength.md) to efficiently wear armor, or be subject to a penalty to all [Skills Checks](./Skill%20Check.md) and [Saving Throws](./Saving%20Throw.md) equal to the difference.  
  
Armor can be affected by [Intrinsic Enchantment](./Intrinsic%20Enchantment.md). Improve the weight and cover by the intrinsic enchantment value.
