As an [Action](./Action.md), you make a long jump with an [Agility](./Agility.md) [Skill Check](./Skill%20Check.md). As with all jumps, you must make an agility [Saving Throw](./Saving%20Throw.md) if you jump from difficult or uneven terrain (or fall [Prone](./Prone.md) in place), and another if you are landing in difficult or uneven terrain (or fall prone at the destination). The difficulty of the agility check is equal to the declared jump distance in feet, and if you fail you land prone, having jumped as many feet as you rolled. The max distance of your jump is equal to half your movement, unless you can get a 10' run-up. This action includes the movement for the jump, but not any additional movement for a run-up.  
  
### Amped Effect  
You don't need a 10' run up to get a full length jump, and you add 10 to the agility check result.
