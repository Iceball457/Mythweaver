# Channeling

As an [[./Action|Action]], you begin charging a spell. Pay the costs of the spell. If the spell's [[./Casting Time|Casting Time]] is instant, resolve the spell immediately. Otherwise, your turn ends. At the beginning of your first turn after the spell's casting time ends, cast the spell.

Spell channeling can be [[./Interrupt|Interrupted]]. If you take any damage while casting, you must make a [[./Vitality|Vitality]] [[./Saving Throw|Saving Throw]] against a DC equal to the damage taken, or have the spell disrupted by damage.

If you take other actions or reaction before the casting time is up, the spell is disrupted.

# Resolution
Once the spell is ready to resolve, make a [[./Skill Check|Skill Check]] against the attribute you use for your [[./Magical Tradition|Magical Tradition]]. On a pass, perform the effects of the spell as listed. On a failure, the spell is usually lost.
