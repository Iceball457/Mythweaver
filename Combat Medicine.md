As an [[./Action|Action]], choose a character that is [[./Downed|Downed]] and make a [[./Wisdom|Wisdom]] [[./Skill Check|Skill Check]]. On a pass, that character removes 1 damage of any type and rejoins the fight. Their new [[./Initiative|Initiative]] comes immediately before yours, as they must spend some time gathering their things off the ground.

### Amped Effect
