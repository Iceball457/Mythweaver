As an [Action](./Action.md), choose a [character](./Character.md) that is [Downed](./Downed.md) and make a [Wisdom](./Wisdom.md) [Skill Check](./Skill%20Check.md). On a pass, that [character](./Character.md) removes 1 damage of any type and rejoins the fight. Their new [Initiative](./Initiative.md) comes immediately before yours, as they must spend some time gathering their things off the ground.  
  
### Amped Effect
