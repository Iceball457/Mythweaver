When you get a level, you get some number of [Attribute Boosts](./Attribute%20Boosts.md). When you receive multiple [Attribute Boosts](./Attribute%20Boosts.md) at the same time, they cannot stack.  
  
|Level|Stat Boosts|  
|:-:|:-:|  
|1|3|  
|2|6|  
|3|3|  
|4|9|  
|5|3|  
|6|6|  
  
*Stat boosts earned on each level.*  
  
In addition, mark two boxes in the action section of your [character](./Character.md) sheet. Normally, actions can only be [Amped](./Amped.md) *or* [Quickened](./Quickened.md), but not both.
