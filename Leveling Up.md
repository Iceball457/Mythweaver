When you get a level, you get some number of [[./Attribute Boosts|Attribute Boosts]]. When you receive multiple [[./Attribute Boosts|Attribute Boosts]] at the same time, they cannot stack.

*Stat boosts earned on each level.*

In addition, mark two boxes in the action section of your character sheet. Normally, actions can only be [[./Amped|Amped]] *or* [[./Quickened|Quickened]], but not both.
