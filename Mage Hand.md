Conjure a spectral hand that mimics your own movements. It lasts until you fall asleep. The hand can interact with and attack things as if it were a hand. ^effect

The mage hand has no mind of its own, and you must spend your quick action to guide it or it will automatically take no actions and pass its turn.
