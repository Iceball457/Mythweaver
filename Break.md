As an [Action](./Action.md), target a terrain feature, an opponent's shield, or another destructible object and roll a [Strength](./Strength.md) [Skill Check](./Skill%20Check.md). On a pass, the object is destroyed, or takes [Damage](./Damage.md) or [Shred](./Shred.md) as appropriate. You are allowed to know if this is possible before you commit to the action.  
  
### Amped Effect  
  
You automatically pass the strength check.
