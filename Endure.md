As an [[./Action|Action]], choose a status affecting you and make a [[./Vitality|Vitality]] [[./Saving Throw|Saving Throw]]. On a pass, reduce that status by one stage. Some status effects will require a different saving throw instead.

### Amped Effect
You may choose an additional status effect, or reduce one status effect by two stages.
