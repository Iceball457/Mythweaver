As an [Action](./Action.md), choose a status affecting you and make a [Vitality](./Vitality.md) [Saving Throw](./Saving%20Throw.md). On a pass, reduce that status by one stage. Some status effects will require a different saving throw instead.  
  
### Amped Effect  
You may choose an additional status effect, or reduce one status effect by two stages.
