Every 2 [[./Stretch|Stretches]] spent researching grants the character an amount of arcane research equal to their [[./Intellect|Intellect]]. Every 1 stretch spent researching grants half that amount rounded down.

For example, a character with 11 intellect that spends 3 stretches researching gains `11 * 3/2 = 16` arcane research.

Arcane research is a temporary resource that must be spent before the character finishes resting. It can be spent preparing arcane spells and scrolls. The cost of researching a spell may be listed, otherwise use the following values.

|1st|10|
|2nd|20|
|3rd|30|
|4th|40|
