# Cast  
  
Through prayer or dark rituals, you force a spirit back into its body and awaken the mind.  
  
You return life to a willing target in range that died within the last 7 days. ^effect  
  
If this spell fails for any reason, the soul is destroyed and that target can no longer be revived.  
  
The target recovers with all but one void damage.
