# Cast  
  
You shake off any feelings of dread or entrapment.  
  
A willing target in range becomes inspired, cannot have their movement reduced, and always passes agility saving throws; until their next turn. You gain an inspiration die. ^effect  
  
Each inspiration die may be spent after a roll to make that roll an additional time, dropping the worst result.
