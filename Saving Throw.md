When you need to perform a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate attribute. If the result is equal to or greater than the DC of the save you get a *Pass*, otherwise you get a *Fail*. Certain effects will ask for the number result instead of just pass or fail.

A saving throw of average difficulty has a DC of 21, and most DCs fall between 18 and 24

`d20 + attr >= DC`
