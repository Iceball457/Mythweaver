When another character you can reach performs a non-attack action, as an [Action](./Action.md), make an [Awareness](./Awareness.md) [Skill Check](./Skill%20Check.md). On a pass, the target must make a [Talent](./Talent.md) [Saving Throw](./Saving%20Throw.md) to mask their movements or have the action disrupted. If the action is lost, all costs associated with that action are also lost.  
  
### Amped Effect  
You can distract at a distance up to your [Targeting Range](./Targeting%20Range.md), as long the target can see you.
