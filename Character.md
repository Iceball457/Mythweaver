# Overview

A character is a single entity, controlled either by a player or the DM.

Each character primarily consists of 9 [[./Attribute|Attributes]] which determine how likely they are to succeed at a variety of tasks.

Each character has an inventory of 6 spaces, with an additional space for each point in [[./Strength|Strength]] beyond the 10th.

Characters can have abilities which grant powers beyond the scope of these rules. If there is a conflict, the ability takes precedence.

# Creation

## Attribute Assignment

You may choose one of the standard arrays, or to roll your [[./Attribute|Attributes]].

### Standard Array

Choose one of the following, per your DM.

 |High Power|Normal|Low Power|
 |:-:|:-:|:-:|
 |12|12|12|
 |11|11|11|
 |10|10|10|
 |9|9|9|
 |9|9|8|
 |8|8|7|
 |8|7|6|
 |7|6|5|
 |6|5|4|
*The standard array.*

### Rolled Attributes

First, set your signature attribute to 12.
Then, roll `3d6 keep 2` 8 times, and assign the results to each of your other attributes.

## Calculated Values

[[./Agility|Agility]], [[./Intellect|Intellect]], [[./Finesse|Finesse]], [[./Wisdom|Wisdom]], [[./Charisma|Charisma]], and [[./Talent|Talent]] all have calculated values. These values change at 3, 4, 6, 9, 13, 16, and 18, and are used to convert your attribute values into more useful numbers like movement speed in feet per action.

|Value|Movement|Range|Spell Rank|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|3+|10'|20'|N/A|
|4+|15'|30'|1st|
|6+|20'|40'|2nd|
|9+|25'|50'|3rd|
|13+|30'|60'|4th|
|16+|35'|70'|5th|
|18|40'|80'|6th|

# Level

Characters in Mythweaver begin at level 0, representing a commoner. Your DM may have you begin the game at level 1, representing an adventurer with some prior experience.

If so, you will begin the game by [[./Leveling Up|Leveling Up]].

# Equipment

Characters will need one or two [[./Weapon|Weapons]], [[./Armor|Armor]], and a [[./Shield|Shield]]; in addition to any other adventuring equipment they desire.
