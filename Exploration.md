# Game Flow  
Exploration turns are divided into [Stretches](./Stretch.md).  
  
Whenever one or more members of the party is idle, they may decide to begin an activity. Some activities have a specific time cost, others can be sustained for any number of stretches.  
  
Most of the time, stretches will be spent moving, searching, or resting. When the party is resting, each individual may choose more specific resting activities.  
  
If there are [Random Encounters](Random%20Encounters.md) in your area, they will usually be rolled once per stretch.  
  
# Activities  
- **Move**: Any members of the party may move together using the slowest [Exploration Speed](./Exploration%20Speed.md) among members of that group.  
- **Search**: A single [Character](./Character.md) may spend 1 stretch to roll [Awareness](./Awareness.md) attempt to find secrets in a 10' area.  
- **Rest**: Any members of the party may rest together.  
	- **Medicine**: A single character may spend 1 stretch to roll [Wisdom](./Wisdom.md) to remove `1d4` damage of one type from themselves or another resting party member. On a failure, remove 1 damage instead.  
	- **Repair**: A single character may spend 1 stretch to roll [Talent](./Talent.md) to restore a set of armor or shield.  
	- **Research**: A single character may spend stretches to gain [Arcane Research](./Arcane%20Research.md) equal to their [Intellect](./Intellect.md).  
  
*Adventurers may perform any actions deemed reasonable by the DM, in addition to those listed.*
